  content: 'Dear Alexander,

    Thank you for Nora and slay at your lake house.
    We had the moct splendid honeymoon a newlywed couple could ask for. The lake
    is just wonderful and the water is warm. Bjorn even invited us over to his house
    at the end of the street to eat his famous Julukake.


    Sincerely,

    Anders
