  content: "Dear Fader Olav,\n\nI am deeply troubled by my grandson Magnus. I believe
    he might have lost his way and I don\u2019t know what to do. He talks about going
    to Oslo and work in the city. I see that he longs freedom and the excitement
    of the urban area, but we our family has been working lumber on our own for generations
    now. Oh! Fader Olav, how can I reason with him?"
